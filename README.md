# CPSC 431 Final Project: Harmonic Progression Platformer
## by Neo Khan and Rachel Blumenthal

### Background 
This final project was inspired by our Harmonic Progression homework assignment. Yeah that's it.

### Setting up the Project
To set up the project, simply install all dependencies listed in **requirements.txt**. You will also need Python3 to run this project.
Run the following command: `pip -r requirements.txt`

### Running the Project
To run the project, you will need to have two separate Terminal windows/tabs as well as the SuperCollider3 project open. 
The Terminal windows will be used to run the Python code.

#### Running Python Code
Run `python3 server.py` to run the Python OSC server so it can communicate with SuperCollider3.
Run `python3 game.py` to run the actual game.

#### Running SuperCollider3 Code

### Playing the Game
Playing the game is fairly simple. You can control the User Sprite (white block) with the *arrow keys*.
You can jump between platforms with the *spacebar*.
